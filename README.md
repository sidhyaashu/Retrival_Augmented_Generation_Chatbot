LangChain: LangChain is a framework that makes it easier to build applications that use large language models (like GPT-4). It provides tools to connect these models with data sources, handle complex workflows, and chain different steps together in a logical way.

LangChain-Core: This is the main, central part of LangChain. It contains the core functionalities needed for building applications, like defining how to connect different pieces (e.g., data inputs, language models, outputs) and how they interact with each other.

LangChain-Community: This part of LangChain includes contributions from the community. It has extra tools, connectors, and modules that users and developers have created to extend LangChain's capabilities, making it more versatile and customizable for various applications.
